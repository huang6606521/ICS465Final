    <img class="ui medium floated right image" src="/images/Neal.png">
    <p>ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors. Collaborative Study (CS) is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.</p>

    <p>All CS meetings are held in the ICSpace located in POST 318B, which is open 24/7/365. The ICSpace is an interactive classroom intended for the use of the ICS Community. Click <a href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/community/post-318b/">here</a> for more information about the ICSpace.</p>
